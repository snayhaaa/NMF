# NMF
Speech signal separation using NMF( MATLAB).

Developed a system to optimize signal and seperate different types of audio signal from a single input.

Eg: If we have an input signal with a lot of noises in it such as a speech, background noises, a baground music etc.. this system can identify difference in signal and can seperate it.

Designed and implemented NMF and spectrogram techniques for effective feature extraction.

Please find the attached file for the project.
